              The layout has been done with bootstrap 3 and its breakpoints.

              Semantic layout has been done for this assigment too, not just the test 2

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              The button text has been pulled from a json data via HttpClient.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              Model has been defined for proper type casting.

              Internationalization has been implemented with ng2-translate ( https://github.com/ngx-translate/core). The angular specific
              internationalization steps is still vague, tedius and doesnt support dynamic texts atleast till Version 6.
              So relied on Subject & observables to pull in language specific text calling different methods mocking a server
              API call. Localization is done for french & english.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              The layout responds to the designs attached in test. Flexbox layout with sass has been used for the styling.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              If there is only one button, it centers in the middle of the screen as the spec mentions.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              The button height is adjusted dynamically with directives. The dropdown in the header menu is also a directive. Bootstrap.js
              is not used for the functionality of opening the dropdown.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              Use the dropdown option "Change Language" in the navigation bar to switch between languages.
            </li>

              Basic Accessibility checklists, acceptance criterias, ARIA-ROLES etc has been used along with proper semantics.

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              Skip links has been added to help the screen reader to switch to transfer option straight thereby skipping other buttons
              in between.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              Each accessibility change has been commented on top as to the reason of that choice.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" aria-hidden="true"></span>
              Submitting the form programmatically focuses the alert model.

              The accessibility audit has been done with "Lighthouse" that comes with the Accessibility developer tools in Chrome. It scores
              a 100 and passes 8 audit tests ( check the attched screenshot )
